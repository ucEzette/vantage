# Hackathon Strategy

## 7. Competitive Positioning

| Platform | Target | Differentiator |
|---|---|---|
| **Stripe Atlas** | Human incorporation | Legal/tax automation |
| **Virtuals** | Agent tokenization | Web3-only, speculative |
| **Corpus Protocol** | Agent incorporation + autonomous GTM | Accessible to anyone, real revenue structure, local execution |

## 8. Demo Scenario

**3-minute live demo:**

| Time | Action |
|---|---|
| 0:00 - 0:30 | Enter product + configure GTM channels → Creator signs `createCorpus` tx |
| 0:30 - 1:00 | Pulse token minted on-chain via HTS precompile → 97% to Creator, 3% launchpad fee to protocol wallet **(Hedera Tokenization)** |
| 1:00 - 1:30 | `vantage-agent start` → Agent requests first posting approval → Approve → Post to X via local Chrome |
| 1:30 - 2:00 | Agent autonomously decides: "need an image" → discovers Corpus B service → x402 $0.05 USDC gas-free payment via Circle Nanopayments on Arc → image received → posts with image **(ARC Nanopayments)** |
| 2:00 - 2:30 | Agent judges low engagement → purchases GTM Playbook via x402 on Arc → applies new strategy → next post uses Playbook templates **(ARC — self-evolving agent)** |
| 2:30 - 3:00 | Revenue from sold service → 100% to Agent Treasury → Agent uses surplus for Pulse buyback & burn **(Agent Treasury Model)** |

**Judge impact:**
- **Hedera judges:** Agent autonomously manages a token economy — issues equity (Pulse), handles governance on Hedera
- **ARC judges:** Agent-to-agent HTTP 402 nanopayments (USDC on Arc via Circle Nanopayments) — gas-free service purchases + Playbook trading + Agent Treasury management, self-evolving strategy. Uses Circle Developer-Controlled Wallets + Nanopayments API + x402 protocol
- **Both:** The agent operates the user's actual browser, makes autonomous payment decisions with human-in-the-loop for high-value transactions

## 9. Prize Strategy

| Track | What We Show | No Overlap With | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hedera — AI & Agentic Payments** | Hedera Agent Kit autonomous Pulse token operations, governance, equity management | ARC (different chain, different token, different purpose) | $6K |
| **Hedera — Tokenization** | Pulse token (HTS), governance voting weight, Patron registry | ARC (Pulse is internal governance, not commerce) | $2.5K |
| **ARC — Agentic Nanopayments** | x402 + Circle Nanopayments on Arc, gas-free USDC agent-to-agent commerce, inter-Corpus service marketplace + Playbook trading + Agent Treasury management. Circle Developer tools: Developer-Controlled Wallets, Nanopayments API | Hedera (different chain, different token, different purpose) | $6K |
| **World — Agent Kit** | World ID trust layer for Prime Agent | — | $8K |
| **World — World ID 4.0** | Patron 1-person-1-vote, Kernel governance uniqueness | — | $8K |

**Maximum Target: $30.5K**

**Clean separation pitch:**
- Hedera = "The agent's **governance and identity layer**" (Pulse on Hedera)
- ARC = "The agent's **treasury and procurement department**" (USDC on Arc via x402 + Circle Nanopayments)
